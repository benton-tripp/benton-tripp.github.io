## What a "Data Scientist" is to Me

### What do I think being a "data scientist" is about?

To me, being a data scientist is about finding value and insights from data using a combination of math/statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge. The types of problems that "data science" can solve are vast, and as such the job involves a lot of creativity and problem-solving. It's about looking at a dataset and figuring out innovative ways to extract meaningful insights. It's about not just answering questions, but figuring out which questions to ask in the first place.

### What are the major duties and knowledge areas?

The major duties of a data scientist include:

- Cleaning, transforming, and validating data
- Analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends
- Using statistical methods and visualization tools to interpret data
- Feature engineering
- Building statistical and machine learning models that can help to identify patterns in the data as well as make predictions

The knowledge areas include:

- Mathematics and Statistics
- Programming (Python, R, Java, etc.)
- Machine Learning
- Data Wrangling and Data Management
- Data Visualization
- Cloud Technologies and Data Platforms
- Communication Skills
- Ethics (often overlooked, but vital)

### What differences (and similarities) are there between data scientists and statisticians?

In my opinion, the line distinguishing a data scientist from a statistician is becoming more and more blurred, and will most likely continue to do so as the fields evolve. Both use mathematics to interpret and model data, often following a similar process. Although they might have some differing terminology, the core of much of what they each do is very similar. 

Perhaps the greatest difference between a data scientist and a statistician is the emphasis on prediction versus inference. Data scientists often prioritize predictive modeling and using data to make accurate predictions or forecasts. They employ machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling techniques to identify patterns and trends in data. On the other hand, statisticians often place more emphasis on statistical inference and drawing conclusions about populations based on sample data. They focus on understanding relationships between variables and making inferences about the underlying population. Of course, it's worth noting that this difference is not absolute and may vary depending on the specific roles and contexts in which data scientists and statisticians operate. 

### How do I see myself in relation to these two areas?

I come from a data science background, but have a deep passion for mathematics. Although I am not a statistician as I still lack the formal education and training required, I like to think of myself as one of the individuals that continues to "blur the lines" between the two fields.
